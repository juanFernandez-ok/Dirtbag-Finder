# Dirtbag-Finder
Final project for Concordia Bootcamp

In this project I built a web app that connects rock climbers  üßóüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è . The main object of the app is to find partners for climbing trips to different locations or partners for climbing in the city‚Äôs gyms. There are different types of climbing but except from Bouldering, you usually need to climb with a partner. This app helps addressing that common ‚Äúproblem‚Äù in the climbing community.

FEATURES:

‚Ä¢ Sign in/landing page via Auht0
‚Ä¢ HomePage with 3 main sections, Profile, Partners, Gyms
‚Ä¢ Profile page. Here each user can edit/update their profile info, create or delete posts, view their requests and delete them, etc
‚Ä¢ Partners page is divided in 2 sections ‚Äúindoors‚Äù and ‚Äúoutdoors‚Äù. In here, the current user can navigate through different posts made by other users, view their profiles and send requests to climb together.
‚Ä¢ Gym page consist of a map from Montreal with pins on all the gyms in the city with their info and link to their websites. I used Google Map API for achieving this.

This project is a full-stack project. I came out with the idea, designed the layout for the FE and structured the data for the BE. I built the Front End with REACT.js and styled with ‚Äústyled components‚Äù. For the Back End I used Node.js, Express and Mongo DB.
